# Lung Cancer Prediction & Interpretability (XAI)

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict lung cancer risk based on clinical and lifestyle attributes. It features a **Random Forest** model and utilizes **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for model transparency and interpretability.

## 🚀 Overview
The primary goal of this project is to bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinical trust. By providing local explanations for every prediction, we can understand why a patient is classified as "High Risk" or "Low Risk."

### Key Features
- **High Accuracy:** Optimized Random Forest Classifier.
- **Explainability:** Integrated SHAP waterfall plots for "Local Interpretability."
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A Streamlit-based web interface for real-time risk assessment.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of anonymized patient data with 15 clinical and lifestyle attributes:
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender
- **Lifestyle:** Smoking, Alcohol Consuming, Peer Pressure
- **Symptoms:** Yellow Fingers, Anxiety, Chronic Disease, Fatigue, Allergy, Wheezing, Coughing, Shortness of Breath, Swallowing Difficulty, Chest Pain

*Note: All features are encoded numerically (e.g., 1 for No/Low, 2 for Yes/High).*
